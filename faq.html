        <div class="answer answer3">
          As teachers and staff, we understand the stress that are put onto our upperclassman. Some may not have made decisions as to the future yet and that is perfectly fine. This is one more way that our staff can be of a guiding hand before our graduating class steps into the real world on their own.

        <!--fifth question -->

        <div class="answer answer4">
          Putting such crucial information into one, easy-to-find space, allows our students to find a starting place to understand what the next steps are and what they want to do after graduation. This also allows for our partners to directly connect with students and bring them opportunities they may not have been able to find through simple networking.
